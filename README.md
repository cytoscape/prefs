Unit test of the interface for 3.7 Preferences

(The Jar is unsigned so you may have to go System Preferences / Security to allow it to open.)

Once you download, authorize and open the program, you should see this:

This prototype will read from your current preferences saved by Cytoscape, but will not write back any changes.
